Kubernetes.APIObject:
  derived_from: Kubernetes.Base
  description: >
    Base type for Kubernetes API objects (persisted resources that can be
    created/applied on their own, e.g. Service, Deployment, ServiceAccount).
    Adds the required Kubernetes API identity fields and a free-form spec.
  properties:
    apiVersion:
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        Kubernetes API version for the resource (e.g. "v1", "apps/v1").
    kind:
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        Kubernetes resource kind (e.g. "Service", "Deployment").
    spec:
      type: map
      required: false
      description: >
        Resource specification content. Structure is kind-specific.

Volume:
  derived_from: Kubernetes.Base
  description: >
    Base volume type used to model container storage that can be mounted into
    a microservice. Concrete volume types (for example EmptyDir and HostPath)
    derive from this type.

Volume.EmptyDir:
  derived_from: Volume
  description: >
    Ephemeral scratch volume whose lifecycle is tied to the workload instance.
    It is created when the workload starts and removed when the workload stops.
    Equivalent intent to Kubernetes emptyDir.
  properties:
    medium:
      type: string
      required: false
      constraints:
      - valid_values: ["", "Memory"]
      description: >
        Storage medium for the emptyDir. Use "" for node storage (default) or
        "Memory" to request a tmpfs-backed in-memory volume (size may be limited
        by the platform).
    sizeLimit:
      type: string
      required: false
      description: >
        Optional upper bound for the volume size (for example "512Mi", "1Gi"),
        interpreted by the orchestrator/platform where supported.

Volume.HostPath:
  derived_from: Volume
  description: >
    Volume backed by a directory or file path on the host (node) filesystem,
    mounted into the workload. Equivalent intent to Kubernetes hostPath.
    Use with care as it couples the workload to the host's filesystem layout.
  properties:
    path:
      type: string
      required: true
      description: >
        Absolute path on the host machine to mount into the workload.

        description: >
          The username for the container registry.
      password:

        description: >
          The password or token for the container registry.
      registry_url:

        description: >
          The URL of the container registry.
